###Working on My Own

It's kind of lonely. I miss having other people to work with and to be able to
bounce ideas off of other people. Thankfully, we're still allowed to talk to
other people, so I still talk to the other students, my mentor, and instructors
to get ideas. I'm moving about as slow as I expected. I know I get caught up in
my ideas a lot and when I don't have people to talk to, I can get stuck on the
same problem because I can't stop myself from thinking of lots of different
approaches.

Progress seemed a little slow, but fortunately there aren't a lot of complicated
parts to it. Working with my mentor, I'm basically done with the API
requirement. The most difficult part will probably figuring out processing.js to
do some fun animations.

###The Future

####Changing My Focus
I would like to fine tune my process. None of the projects I've worked had
spectacular end results. I learned a lot in each of them, but I think I need to
shift my focus from learning new technology to being able to build a product in
an agile way. While I know I should be doing things in short sprintts,
I sometimes have trouble with the whole "always build as much as you need for
your mvp" kind of thing.

####What does success look like now?
Upon starting the program, all handwavily new that I wanted to come out being
a **good** developer, not a clever or scrappy one. While that's still true,
I think my idea of what a good developer is has changed. It used to be that
a good developer is someone who knows how to build stable, maintainable,
extensible, flexible programs. While this is still true, I'd like to add that
a good developer also knows when and how to balance good development with the
needs of the client or company. A good developer can communicate and cooperate
well with his or her team.
