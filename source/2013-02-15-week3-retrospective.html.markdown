I've successfully survived the third week of gSchool! This week we talked about
development tools and were assigned SalesEngine.

## SalesEngine
From my perspective, there are a few things to learn from SalesEngine:
1. TDD
2. Paired Programming
3. Using git

### TDD
I'm so excited to be able to practice TDD! This project has really helped me
practice doing TDD instead of Test First. I didn't realize how well conditioned
I am to immediately think of how to implement a bunch of things at once. I have
to force myself to NOT think ahead and simply think of how I want to **use** the
application. It was hard starting off, but the process is becoming more and more
natural the more I practice.

We were required to use MiniTest for testing, and because I'm unfamiliar with
how to mock and stub with that library (and also haven't been in the mood to
figure out how), our tests are very simply in concept. (We might be asserting
one too many things in one test) As a result, the methods and classes we're
testing are fairly loosely coupled.

I have a feeling we're not setting up some of our tests correctly though.
I don't have a lot of faith in some of them, which is *bad*. This is partly
because of the way we setup our test data. Honestly, it would be great if we
could setup the tests so that we weren't dependent on data files, but oh well!
It's definitely convenient to have test data files but it's becoming a slight
pain in the butt. Our files don't have enough information to test everything
well. I forsee us changing the data files and then needing to change some tests
to match that data. I wonder if there's a way to do this more easily....

### Paired Programming
I'm glad that we are doing this projec in pairs. There's a lot of repetitive
work so it's pretty easy to say "We're going to go in this direction and repeat
the process with other similar methods." It's also nice to be able to bounce
ideas off of each other and talk through stuff.

Sometimes I think I could faster on my own, but I can see myself getting lazy
and not testing as thoroughly and making lots of mistakes that will slow me down
later on.

I still have issues communicating my thoughts; communication has always been
a weak point of mine so I hope that as we continue work in groups, it will
improve.

### Using git
We were assigned a partner to work on the project and for once in my life, I'm
using version control in a group project. I'm so thankful to learn how to use
git, but at the same time it's definitely caused some headache. After a week of
practicing branching and merging, I'm still having issues. I'll need to go
through the git tutorial we did last week again.

## Becoming a Developer
I've considered myself a developer for the past 1.5 years since I was doing Java
development before joining gSchool. However, during all that time as a PAID
developer, I never really felt good enough. In just three weeks at gSchool, I've
learned so much more about the development process, techniques, etc than I did
being employed.

I'm much more confident in my skills and abilities than I was starting. If this
is how I feel after only three weeks, I can't wait to see how I'll develop in
the remaining 21 months.

I've also noticed that I'm much more open to admitting if I'm struggling or need
help. I used to be very independent and spend too much time trying to solve
problems on my own, but that is changing. Right now my main resource is other
students and instructors.
