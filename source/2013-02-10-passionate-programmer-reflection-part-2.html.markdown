*The Passionate Programmer* emphasizes being "remarkable" by putting yourself
out there way more than I am comfortable with. The part that stood out the most
to me was the tip on writing a book or maintaing a blog. As someone who detests writing
(yes, even putting this blog post together is killing me), I cannot imagine
being **the person** who wrote **the book** on whatever topic. Getting really
involved in any type of community has never been something I'm interested in.
I'm a "lurker." When I have an interest, I'll tag along with people who are
knolwedgable in that area, and learn from them. I *won't* contribute because
I don't feel like what I have to say is good enough.

However, I realize that if I really want to be "remarkable," then I'll have to
break out of this shell. So while I cringe just thining about, maintaining a 'Ruby for
Beginners' blog would probably help me in the long run. This blog would allow me
to do a few things:

    * become a "virtual mentor" for whomever stumbles upon the blog
    * make my presence known to the community

We'll see how this goes...
