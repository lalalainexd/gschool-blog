###Learning Rails

This week we started learning about the rails framework. It's kind of nice to be
able to use commands to generate most of what I need. I'm not as big of a fan of
scaffolds as I thought I woudld be. There's a lot of generated crap.. uh..
I mean unnecessary stuff that comes with scaffolding. I also feel like
I *instantly* become less familiar with MY application when using scaffolds.
I also feel like using scaffolds makes me generate from inside out, working on
the models up to the views, but as I've mentioned in previous posts (er I think
I mentioned it) I'm beginning to appreciate building my application from outside
in. At the end of the day, the view is what's most important and in order to
know what you need to support those views, you have to build them first.

Compared to sinatra though, it does feel "heavy" and "stiff", but I don't think
I'm at the point where I know either of them well enough to really compare them
any more. I get the feeling that sinatra is easier to configure because it
doesn't come with a whole lot, but then you have to know what you're trying to
build and what gems you need to add on. This isn't to say that you get
everything you need with rails, but most of what you need to get a simple
application running is already there.

I'm curious about how (or if) people use sinatra to build large scalable
applications and how that compares with rails. A lot of people say that rails
isn't good for buildling large applications, but I think it's really just how
you use the tool. My friend Tien, who works for
[customink](http://www.customink.com) would certainly agree.

I attended boulderruby where Ben Orenstein spoke about refactoring. I was so
inspired that I read the first few chapters of *Refactoring*. The next day, he
came in for a Q&A session with gSchool. It was awesome! Without saying it
explicitly, he reminded me about agile development. The biggest takeaway for me
was to think in small short iterations. **If I only have two or three days to
build something, what is the MOST important feature to implement in order to
have a product?** I'm going to use this approach for future projects at gSchool
and throughout my life as a professional developer.
