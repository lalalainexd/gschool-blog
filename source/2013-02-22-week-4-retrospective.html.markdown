##SalesEngine

This week, we completed and turned in the SalesEngine project. The most
surprising thing about working on this project is how stressed I didn't feel.
Laura and I set a very generous plan and early in the project, we found
ourselves way ahead of schedule. I think the latest I stayed up to work on
SalesEngine was 11:30pm and that was mostly because I didn't feel like doing
anything else at the time. Towards the last few days, we decided to take our
time with refactoring and cleaning up our code instead of writing the
extensions. I think doing this was a much more valuable lesson for us then
simply implementing more stuff.

As a pair, I think Laura and I worked pretty well together. We communicated
pretty well and split the workload very evenly. I never got the the feeling that
either one of us *had* to lead; we were just peers working together.

If we were to redo this project, I'd simply spend a little more time on the
project so that we could get the extensions in. I'm sure there's also a lot more
code cleaning we could have done. This time, I used the resources we had a lot
more than the last project, but I think we could have asked for more help, not
on how to do stuff, but how to improve our code.

##Becoming a Developer

I'm really excited to move into web development. Afterall, it's always been an
interest of mine. I don't there's anything about it that makes me nervous, but
I've always been more of an optimist.
