##We're officially one month in. How are you feeling?"

_ECSTATIC_

During the first week of the program, I was so excited about gSchool and
I still am, but for a different reason. Starting off, I was just happy to be in
gSchool knowing that'd I'd gain real practical skills/experience as a programmer. I knew going
in that I'd be learning a lot and would get a lot out of this program. What
I didn't know was exactly what or how much I'd learn.

I came in thinking I'd mostly learn how to program in Ruby and Rail, some best
practicies and make new network connections. In just one month, gSchool has
surpassed my expectations. Not only are we learning how to program, we're
learning the ins and outs of the industry. In one months we have covered:


  - ruby
  - version control (meaning git)
  - paired programming practices
  - testing paradigms using minitest and rspec
  - creating stories to help breakdown tasks and communicate better with clients via pivotal tracker
  - intro to MVC via sinatra
  - tips on setting up our environments
  - and SO much more...

*Sorry if the list looks funny... I'll fix that later.*

This is so much more than I expected in just the first month and I can't even
imagine the depth and scope of what we'll learn in regards to Rails and web
development. Did I mention that I'm **super** ecstatic?

I still feel like I need to ask for help more often. I'm having issues breaking
out of the habit of trying to do and learn everything on my own. I've getting
a little better with that, especially when working on group projects, but I know
that I'm still not using all the resources that ar available to me. Part of my
problem is that I'm never aware that I'm stuck or I think it's too small of
a problem to bother someone else with. For the next month, I really hope to work
on this. I **need** to learn how to ask questions so I can progress better and
faster.

I've also been taking care not to burn myself out too quickly and not pushing
myself as hard as I normally would. While it helps with keeping the overall
stress levels down, I also feel like I'm not going to get as much out of gSchool
if I continue like this. So in addition to using my resources more, I'm going to
work on finding a better school-life balance so that I don't feel like I'm
lagging behind my own expectations.
