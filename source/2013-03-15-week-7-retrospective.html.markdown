This week we split up into groups and worked on different projects. My group
worked on a bitly-like application called Jet Fuel. We used sinatra and active
record to build it.

My favorite part of the project was the cucumber extension. I really enjoyed
beginning to learn how to write integration tests/BDD. Unfortunately, I didn't
complete the project since I got a little over excited and distracted with
familiarizing myself with capybara too, but I'm glad to be able to add this to
my programmer's toolbox.

After this week, I would really like to get more practice project workflow.
I feel that I'm at a point where I know a little bit of a lot of things and so
I'd like to figure out how to put together everything I know.

Yesterday we reviewed each other's code. One of my classmates finished his
project in only a couple days. I was surprised until I found out he wrote only
ONE test that didn't really test anything. This got me thinking about my current
approach to projects. So far, I haven't been able to complete any of the
extensions of our assigned projects and so I feel really unsatisfied when I see
other people finishing their projects much faster than me. I realized that a lot
of them aren't testing, or at the least aren't doing TDD. I'm now wondering when
should I be writing tests? I love the TDD approach, and it's very satisfying
knowing that my code always works, but it's a slow process especially because
I'm still learning some of the tools we use. Should I stop being a test nazi and
just get the projects done and test after? I don't like the idea of it, but
I also don't like *feeling* behind.
