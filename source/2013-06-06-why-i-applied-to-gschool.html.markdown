title: Why I Applied to gSchool

During college, whenever I mentioned to people that I was a Computer Science major, there were always two responses I'd get: "Oh wow, you must be really smart" and "You'll never have to worry about finding a job." Then, as I neared graduation, I started applying for jobs. I have to say, people were wrong.

I wasn't as unfortunate as some people. I was able to get a job about 1.5 months after graduating, but getting that first job took a lot more effort than you might think. Why was it so difficult? Part of the problem was that I had very little practical programming experience. I had the theoretical background that would allow me to pick up all sorts of languages pretty quickly, but I never *really* learned about any one in particular. Because of that, I had trouble confidently selling myself. I've never been good at BSing, and I'm even worse on paper. I tend to undersell myself and of course that doesn't impress anyone. As you might imagine, this made getting offers pretty difficult.

Eventually a landed a job offer and accepted it in a heartbeat... and then I regretted it for a long long time. What was wrong with this job? Well for starters, I wasn't doing web development which is what I have always been interested in. I took the job because of money and the pressure to *not* be unemployed. The company was poorly managed. The CEO was always making promises to the client that the developers struggled to keep. The framework we were using was the jankiest piece of crap I've ever seen. No one fully understood how it worked, which is **scary** when it was supposed to be part of our product. There was little to no testing involved so development was extremely slow. We were often working long nights and entire weekends for demo days. I hated my code because I knew it was poorly structure, but the pressure to "just make it work" always won. I knew my code was bad, but I didn't know how to fix it. There was always so much to do that I never felt like I had the time or luxury to refactor or learn how to refactor. It was what I would now consider to be unprofessional work. 

During this time, I was dating a guy who was beginning his career as a Ruby on Rails developer. As a former apprentice of 8th Light, he developed a passion for writing beautiful, and professional code and would tell me about it. I decided I wanted to write good code and be able to take some pride in it. I attempted to implement testing as a practice at my job, but that stopped pretty quickly. The framework was incredibly difficult to mock and stub, and there was just too much pressure to ship code. 

I hated that I couldn't take the time to learn how to be a programmer, and all of the stress was burning me out. I was losing interest fast. I almost never opened my laptop when I was home except to play video games. Otherwise I was working out, watching tv, or at the rock climbing gym. I simply did not want to code.

Then, I found out about gSchool. Right away, I knew it was what I needed to get to where I wanted to be, to reignite the passion I had for building software, and to learn how to be a programmer. I applied, interviewed, and was accepted.

Did the $20k tuition scare me? Yes. Did dropping everything in my life to move to Denver scare me? **Yes**. Was it worth it all? **HELL YES**

Attending gSchool was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I've learned a lot in the past 4.5 months and gained tons of experience. I'm a lot more confident in myself as a developer, and I can call myself that without feeling like a phony. I know I still have a lot more to learn, but the foundation that gSchool has helped me build is invaluable. Could I have eventually learned everything that I learned in gSchool on my own? Maybe, but that would have taken so much longer, and I don't have the patience or self-discipline to do it on my own.

So what has life in gSchool been like?

For the first 1.5 months, we did pure Ruby. No web development whatsoever. We are often told that many Ruby on Rails developers don't actually understand ruby which limits their abilities. From what I've seen on stackoverflow, I don't doubt it. Ruby is the language that Ruby on Rails is built on. It is the foundation to the framework and so it's important to have a good understanding of it. I'm really glad we did because trying to learn the language and the framework at the same time would have been a disaster for many students. Also, by focusing on the language itself, I was able to take the time to adjust my strongly typed, Java mindset to the Ruby, duck typed mindset. During that time, we were introduced to git, unit tests, TDD, agile development, pairing, pivotal tracker, and other tools and techniques that are necessary to be good developers.

Afterwards, we dipped our feet into web development by building an app via sinatra. In this app, we began to touch on html, css, and MVC. Then, we finally went into Ruby on Rails.

Since doing Ruby on Rails I've built projects to learn about:
* restful routes
* feature and integration tests
* javascript/jquery/backbone
* security
* namespacing/scoping routes
* caching via redis and memcache
* background workers via resque
* having lots of skinny models and skinny controllers to keep our code maintainable
* how/when to break up our views into partials
* oauth
* best practices to consuming an api
* how to build our own api
* writing my own gem
* service oriented architecture
