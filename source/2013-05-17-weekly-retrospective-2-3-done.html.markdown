###FeedEngine

####What have been the tough parts so far?

Brad and I decided to be ambitious and make RunLine a single page app. Jumping
into a new framework with a language that we barely know is kind of tough.
I love the challenge though and it's really exciting to try! The process has
been kind of slow, but we're learning a lot. I'm confident that Brad and I will be able to deliver an
excellent frontend experience!

####What's the plan for the enxt six days?

Complete the project of course! More specifically, the frontend needs to be
completed and better integrated with the backend. As a minimum viable product,
we want to be able to create group runs with our application have record
responses to run invitations. After we fully integrate with twitter and
RunKeeper, I believe we'll be adding in MapMyFitness.

###Boulder Startup Week

I'm really glad we were able to visit Quick Left and LivingSocial. While I love
that LivingSocial is very flexible, works in small teams, and doesn't mind
remote workers, I think that when I restart my career as a developer, I still
would like to work at a place like pivotal, thoughtbot, or (totally not
surprising...) Quick Left. Yup, I'm adding Quick Left to my list of companies
I'd like to apply to. What other awesome consulting groups out there?

We (as a class) often ask potential employers what they look for when hiring
people, and one that always comes up is personality. Having empathy, not being a total
jerk, being nice, communicative, and pleasant to work with are qualities
everyone seems to want. I like to think I have these qualities. Can someone tell
me if I'm delusional?

I spent the latter half of Thursday at the PivotalLabs office. It was really
awesome pairing with Mike. Without the context, I wasn't very helpful, but I'm
proud of myself that I was at the least able to understand everything he was
doing. *pats back*
