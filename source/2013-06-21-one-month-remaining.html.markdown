###Gaps?

With one month remaining, I'm thinking about some goals I'd like to reach before
the end of gSchool:

- improve and develop my frontend development skills
  - Build a single page app
    - combined with less or sass and NO scaffolding
  - Write a jquery plugin
- Sign off on a job offer

###Jobs

I've found my perfect/ideal companies: [Pivotal Labs](http://pivotallabs.com/)
and [neo](www.neo.com) (specifically, neo's singapore office).

neo's singapore office was originally owned by Pivotal Labs and still retains
a lot of the Pivotal practices and culture. Even the interview is the same!

Actually, I have a funny story interviewing:

This past Wednesday, I interviewed with Pivotal in the moring and neo in the
evening. Both interviews involve pair programming. When my interview with neo
began, the first thing I saw was the exact same thing I saw at my Pivotal
interview and then this conversation happened..

me: Um.. Before we begin, can I ask you something?
interviewer: Sure.
me: Is this like the RPI?
interviewer: This IS ths RPI.
me: Oh..
interviewer: Have you taken it before?
me: Yeah... in fact, I took it this morning... with Pivotal Labs.

We ended up pairing on a problem that I had done for a warmup. I didn't mention
it this time though since the only thing I could remember about my original
solution was that it was very ugly.
