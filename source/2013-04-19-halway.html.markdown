This week we turned in Son of Store Engine. This is probably my second most
disastrous I've turned in. For this project, I let myself go a bit too much. By
that, I mean I didn't stick to my processes. In fact, from the beginning I gave
into scrappy coding. Cutting corners really kicked my team's butt. At the end of
the project, there was so much technical debt to deal with, that I considered
tearing up everything we did and starting over... So what went wrong and what
went right? Let's start with what went right:

  * Excellent communication with my teammates
  * Much better use with pivotal tracker than in the past
  * Pretty decent merging process

And what went wrong? I'd say a lot of things.

  * We weren't very good about testing.
  * Our code wasn't DRY or WET, it was WETT - Write Everthing **THREE** Times
    There was just way too much repetition in the code. It was a mess.
  * The tests we did have weren't written well. Every merge would cause
    failures. I think I spent three days total fixing broken tests.
  * We spread ourselves too thin. There was a lot of work and we tried too hard
    to just barely scrape by and meet the stories instead of working on just
     few features and doing them well.
  * I stayed up late *coughididntsleepcough* Wednesday night, fixing little bugs
    here and there, but my team didn't have a chance to review the branch and
    merge it in.
