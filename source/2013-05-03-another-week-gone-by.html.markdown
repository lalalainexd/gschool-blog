###DoSE
This was one of the most successful and least stressful projects I've worked on
for gSchool. Why was it so successful? There are a few reasons...
  * We broke down the requirements to into small digestable chunks
  * We focused building out only the features we were requested to build and
    doing them well
  * As we worked on our app, we also cleaned up problems we saw from the legacy
    code

###APIs
I'm super excited to learn about producing and consuming APIs! It's something
knew for me and I'm hoping we'll be able to start building more SOA type
applications.

I think the most difficult part will be producing an API that will be
maintainable, extendable, but also degrade gracefully as updates are made.

###Thoughts of the Future
What do I want to do after the course? I would really love to work for
a consulting group that takes pride in their development practices. Not so
surprisingly, I'm interested in companies that..
  * do TDD
  * follow *real* agile development
  * have a strong emphasis on code quality, both for production and test code
  * enjoy pairing!

Other qualities I've been thinking about...
  * 20% time - I really like the idea of giving employees the time to explore
    and build their own projects that may benefit the company or the world in
    general
  * Sociable, friendly, employees - At my last company, I never felt like
    I could take a break and just chat with a coworker for a while. This was
    partly because I was the only female and could never find anything to talk
    about with the other employes, but it was also due to the fact that there
    was no sense of belonging or group cohesion. It felt like everyone was only there to do
    their job and get paid.
  * conference travel stipend!.. or at least some way of encouraging the
    developers to go to different conferences.

I've been growing more and more confident in my developer skills, but at the
same time, I still feel like a complete noob. Well I am pretty noob. Going
straight into some company kind of intimidates me, so part of me really wants to
do some kind of apprenticeship before jumping on as a full blown employee.
Thoughbot's apprenticship.io program is very enticing. I'd also be very happy to
work for a company like Pivotal. While they don't have an apprenticeship
program, they pair 100% of the time which I think would be another nice way to
"ease" into a real job.

There must be other companies that are similar to thoughtbot or pivotal. I just
need to find them. :)
